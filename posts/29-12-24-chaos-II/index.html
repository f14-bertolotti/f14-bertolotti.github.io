            Now, I would like to start with fixed points and stability. However, to study that we will need a concept of derivative. However, the topological manifold does not have such a concept. So, we will need to build additional structure on top of our manifold to introduce this concept. Furthermore, this is a heavy enough topic to deserve its own post. So, here, we will discuss only the topic of differentiable manifolds.
            </p>

            <h3> Differentiable Manifolds </h3>

            <p>
            <b> Definition (Chart) </b> Let \(\mathcal{M}\) be a manifold. A chart on \(\mathcal{M}\) is a pair \((U,\phi)\) where \(U\) is an open set in \(\mathcal{M}\) and \(\phi:U \rightarrow \phi(U) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) is a homeomorphism (bijective and both \(f\) and \(f^-1\) are continuos) with \(\phi(U)\) also open.
            </p>

            <p>
            Having a chart on a manifold is like having a map between a patch of the manifold (the open set \(U\)) and to a patch of the euclidean space (the open set \(\phi(U)\)). Further, we require this transition to be smooth in both directions (from the manifold to the euclidean space and vice-versa). 
            </p>

            <p>
            <b> Definition (Overlapping Charts) </b> Two charts \((U_i,\phi_i)\) and \((U_j,\phi_j)\) are said to overlap if \(U_i \cap U_j \neq \emptyset\).
            </p>

            <p>
            Nothing to be said here. Just that we need to define this concept to define the next one.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b> Definition (Smooth) </b> A function \(f:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m\) is smooth if all the partial derivatives of all orders exist and are continuous.
            </p>

            <p>
            Smooth functions are those function that are differentiable as many times as you want. Often you will find this class of function under the symbol \(C^\infty\). 
            </p>

            <p>
            <b> Definition (Atlas) </b> An atlas on a manifold \(\mathcal{M}=(X,T)\) is a collection of charts \(\{(U_i,\phi_i)\}_{i \in I}\) such that: 1) \(X \subseteq \cup_{i\in I} U_i \) (that is the open set cover the manifold). 2) For any pair of overlapping charts  \((U_i,\phi_i)\) and \((U_j,\phi_j)\) in the atlas, the transition function \(\phi_j \circ \phi_i^{-1}: \phi_i(U_i \cap U_j) \rightarrow \phi_j(U_i \cap U_j)\) is smooth (that is the charts are compatible).
            </p>

            <p>
            First of all, we are saying that an atlas needs tp cover the whole manifold, nothing surprising. However, we also require a certain property on overlapping charts. We require that the transition between the euclidean patch, image of \(\phi_i\), and the euclidean patch, image of \(\phi_j\), is smooth (and vice-versa). 
            </p>

            <p>
            The atlas of manifold is the object from which many other definition will depend. It is our way to the euclidean space. This way will allow us transport many useful concepts from the euclidean space to the manifold. A, differntial manifold is simply a manifold with an atlas that will allow us transport the concept of differentiation from the euclidean space to the manifold itself.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b> Definition (Differentiable Manifold) </b> A manifold \(\mathcal{M}=(X,T)\) is a differentiable manifold if it has an a smooth atlas.
            </p>

            <p>
            Now, we have the object in which we can compute the differentiation. However, how do we compute the derivative. In  order to do so, let start with an anology. Conisder a curve paratrized according to a time parameter \(t\) living in a n-dimensional euclidean space. We know that the derivative at a point is the tangent vector to the curve at that point. For instance, consider the 2-dimensional curve \(\gamma(t)=(t,\cos(t) + t)\). I have plotted the curve altogether with its (normalized) tangent vectors at several points in the figure below. Each tangent vector (which represent the derivative) lives in the tangent space of \mathbb{R}^2 at the point of interest.
            </p>

            <canvas id="curve2d" width="350" height="100" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></canvas>

            <p>
            In \(\mathbb{R}^n\), you can imagine the tangent space at point \(p\), \(T_p\mathbb{R}^n\), as the space of all possible tangent vectors at the point \(p\). This is a n-dimensional vector space. Below, I plot the 2-dimensional euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^2\) with the tangent space at the point \((1,1)\) in green, \(T_{(1,1)}\mathbb{R}^2\). 
            </p>

            <canvas id="tangentspace" width="350" height="300" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></canvas>

            <p>
            We have the euclidea tangent space. What is the manifold tangent space? For this, we will use our atlas. So consider a chart \((U,\phi)\) from a differentiable manifold \(\mathcal{M}\). We can define the tangent space at a point \(p \in U\), \(T_p\mathcal{M}\), as the euclidean tangent space at the image of point \(p\), that is \(T_{\phi(p)}\mathbb{R}^n\). 
            </p>

            <p>
            <b> Definition (Tangent Space) </b> Let \(\mathcal{M}=(X,T)\) be a differentiable manifold with atlas \(\{(U_i,\phi_i)\}_{i \in I}\). The tangent space at a point \(p \in U_i\), is \(T_p\mathcal{M} = T_{\phi_i(p)}\mathbb{R}^n\). The set of all tangent spaces at all points in the manifold is denoted by \(T\mathcal{M}\).
            </p> 

            <p>
            Now, let us consider a generic function from a differentiable manifold to another, \(f:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow\mathcal{N}\). We will define the derivative of this function at a point \(p\in\mathcal{M}\) simply by using the charts. Let \((U,\phi)\) and \((V,\psi)\) be charts on \(\mathcal{M}\) and \(\mathcal{N}\) respectively such that \(p\in U\) and \(f(p)\in V)\). We define the derivative of \(f\) at \(p\) as the derivative of the function \(\psi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1} = g\) at the point \(\phi(p)\). 
            </p>

            <p>
            Note that this is an intuitive definition. We do not know how to compute the derivative of \(f\) directly at a point \(p\). However, we can project \(p\) to the euclidean space, and use the charts to derive a transformation from and to euclidean space. The derivative of \(f\) a \(p\) will be whatever the derivative of \(g\) at \(\phi(p)\) is.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Despite its intuitiveness, we will have that derivative of \(f\) will depend on the choice of charts. Meaning that, different charts will give different derivatives. We could define the derivative, in such a way that it does not depend on the charts. However, when will need to compute the derivative, we will need to choose a chart anyway. So, we will not bother with this. 
            </p>

            <p>
            <b>Definition (Derivative)</b> Let \(\mathcal{M}\) and \(\mathcal{N}\) be differentiable manifolds. Let \(f:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow\mathcal{N}\) be a function. Let \(p \in \mathcal{M}\). Let \((U,\phi)\) and \((V,\psi)\) be charts on \(\mathcal{M}\) and \(\mathcal{N}\) respectively such that \(p\in U\) and \(f(p)\in V\). The derivative of \(f\) at \(p\) wrt. charts \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) is the jacobian matrix:
            \[
            \begin{aligned}
            D^{\phi,\psi}f(p) = \Large{\begin{bmatrix}  
                \frac{\partial (\psi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1})^i)}
                {\partial x^j}\Bigg|_{\phi(p)}
                \end{bmatrix}}
            \end{aligned}
            \]
            </p>

            <p>
            This is definetely still a little bit abstract. But, we can do a simple example to understand this better.
            </p>

            <h4> Example </h4>

            <p>
            Consider the manifold, \(\mathcal{M}\), made up of point between \(-30\) and \(+30\), \(\{x|x\in(-30,+30)\}\). Consider also the manifold \(\mathcal{N}\), made up from point in the unitary shere \(\{x|x\in\mathbb{R}^3,||x||=1\}\). Let \(f:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow\mathcal{N}\) be the function that maps a point \(x\) to the point in the unitary sphere:
            \[
            f(t)=\left(\frac{\cos(t)}{\sqrt{1+a^2t^2}},\frac{\sin(t)}{\sqrt{1+a^2t^2}},\frac{at}{\sqrt{1+a^2t^2}}\right)
            \]
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Now, we need to define the charts. We will use the chart \((U,\phi)\) on \(\mathcal{M}\) such that \(U=(-30,+30)\) and \(\phi(x)=x\). We will use the stereographic projections for the sphere. That si, \((V,\psi)\) such that \(V\) is the unitary sphere (excluded the north pole) and \(\psi(x,y,z)=(x/(1-z),y/(1-z))\).
            </p>

            <p>
            Over the situtation can be pictured as follows:
            </p>

            <canvas id="example" width="700" height="700" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></canvas>

            <p>
            Using \(\phi\), we can go back and forth from the manifold \(\mathcal{M}\) to the 1-dimensional euclidean space. Using \(\psi\), we can go back and forth from the manifold \(\mathcal{N}\) to the euclidean space. With \(f\), we can go from \(\mathcal{M}\) to \(\mathcal{N}\). Now, we will compute the derivative of \(f\) with respect to the charts \(\phi\) and \(\psi\), this is \(D^{\phi,\psi}f(t)\).

            \[
            \psi(f(t)) = \left( \frac{\cos(t)}{\sqrt{1+a^2t^2} - at}, \frac{\sin(t)}{\sqrt{1+a^2t^2} - at} \right).
            \]

            \[
            \begin{aligned}
            D^{\phi,\psi}f(t) &= \Large{\begin{bmatrix}  
                \frac{\partial (\psi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1})^i)}
                {\partial x^j}\Bigg|_{\phi(p)}
                \end{bmatrix}} \\
                &= \Large{\begin{bmatrix}
                \frac{\partial \frac{\cos(t)}{\sqrt{1+a^2t^2} - at}}{\partial t} & \frac{\partial \frac{\sin(t)}{\sqrt{1+a^2t^2} - at}}{\partial t} \\
                \end{bmatrix}} \\
                &= \begin{bmatrix}
                (-1 - \frac{at}{\sqrt{1 + a^2 t^2}})(-a \cos(t) + \sqrt{1 + a^2 t^2} \sin(t)) \\
                (+1 + \frac{at}{\sqrt{1 + a^2 t^2}})(\sqrt{1 + a^2 t^2} \cos(t) + a \sin(t))
                \end{bmatrix}^T

            \end{aligned}
            \]
            </p>

            <p>
            We can verify that indeed these derivative are correct by plotting them in the sphere.
            </p>

            <p>
            The jacobian is an extremely powerful tool that we can now use. For instance, consider any function\(f:\mathcal{N}\rightarrow\mathcal{M}\), then the jacobian of \(f\), \(D^{\psi,\phi}f(p)\), is the best linear approximation of \(f\) at \(p\). Meaning that, no matter how complex \(f\) is, we can analyze it locally by simply looking at a matrix, the jacobian.
            </p>

            <p>
            This will be the only weapon we will need to characterize the stability of fixed points in dynamical systems. We will see this in the next post.
            </p>

            <h4> Summary And Cautionary Note </h4>

            <p>
            In this section, we have introduced the concept of differentiable manifold. We have defined the tangent space at a point of the manifold. We have also defined the derivative of a function between manifolds. We have done so using charts. We have also done a simple example to illustrate how to compute the derivative of a function between manifolds.
            </p>

            <p>
            Some readers may have expected to see the derivative arrows on the 3d plot. However, the 3d plot is only a 3d-visualization of the manifold. In all reality the manifold \(\mathcal{N}\) is only 2-dimensional. As consequence the derivative of the function \(f\) will be a 2-dimensional vector.
            </p>

            <p>
            The most advanced readers may complain regarding the chart dependant definition of the derivative. They may argue that the derivative should be defined in such a way that it does not depend on the charts. This is possible, however, it requires a level of abstraction that it is not needed for this post.
