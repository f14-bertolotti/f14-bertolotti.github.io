            <div id="canvas-container-rossler" xscale=3 yscale=2 xshift=-5 yshift=+15 width=700 height=300></div>

            <p>
                These days, I am studying a little bit of Chaos Theory on <span class="cite" value="Alligood98"></span> (A great introductory book on the subject by the way). I am going to share some of the things I learned here. However, note that I am no expert on the subject, so take everything with a grain of salt. Furthermore, I am still in the process of learning, so I might make mistakes. If you find any, please let me know. 
            </p>

            <h3> Preliminaries </h3>
                
            <p>
                The theory of chaos is mostly concerned with the study of dynamical systems. Therefore, the first step is to define what a dynamical system really is. Unfortunately, if we want a general definition that will work even outside the classical euclidean space this will require a little bit of work. To properly define a dynamical system we need a few geometrical concepts beforehand. We will start with very basic concepts so you will need to bear with me. Let us start with the concept of topological space.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Definition (Topological Space) </b> A topological space is a pair \((X,\mathcal{T})\) where \(X\) is a set and \(\mathcal{T} \subseteq 2^X\) such that: 
                <ul>
                    <li>1) \(X\) and \(\emptyset\) are in \(\mathcal{T}\),</li>
                    <li>2) the intersection of any two sets in \(\mathcal{T}\) is in \(\mathcal{T}\), and</li>
                    <li>3) the union of any collection (finite of infinite) of sets in \(\mathcal{T}\) is in \(\mathcal{T}\).</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The elements of \(\mathcal{T}\) are called <b>open</b> sets.</p>

            <p>
                You may have noticed an asymmetry in the definition of topological space. We allow for infinite (countable or uncountable) unions but only finite intersections. This came come of as a little weird. However, you need to consider that a topological space wants to be a kind of a generalization of real analysis. And, in real analysis, open sets are not closed under infinite intersections. However, open sets are closed under infinite unions.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b> Definition (Continuos Function) </b> Let \(T_1,T_2\) be topological spaces. A function \(f:T_1 \rightarrow T_2\) is continuous if and only if for every open set \(U \in T_2\), the preimage \(f^{-1}(U)\) is an open set in \(T_1\). 
            </p>

            <p>
            To get an intuition of this definition, it is best if we see it as a generalization of continutity in real analysis. Recall the \(\epsilon\)-\(\delta\) definition of continuity (see <a href=https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Metric_Space_Continuity_by_Epsilon-Delta>here</a>). There, we used open balls to define continuity. We said, a function is continuos if every open ball in the codomain gets mapped to an open ball in the domain. Here, we use open sets instead of open balls since we do not have a metric do define open balls.
            </p>

            <p> <b> Definition (Homeomorphism) </b> A function \(f:T_1 \rightarrow T_2\) is a homeomorphism if it is bijective and both \(f\) and \(f^{-1}\) are continuous. </p>

            <p>
            An homeomorphism is our way of saying that two topological spaces are practically the same. Each element in one space has a corresponding element in the other space. Furthermore, the structure of the spaces (the open sets) is preserved.
            </p>

            <p> 
            <b> Definition (Locally Euclidean) </b> A topological space \(T\) is locally Euclidean if for each point \(x \in T\) there is an open set \(U\) containing \(x\) such that \(U\) is homeomorphic to an open subset of \(\mathbb{R}^n\). 
            </p>

            <p>
                A locally euclidean topological space is simply a topological space for which every point has a open set that looks like an euclidean space.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b> Definition (Hausdorff Space) </b> A topological space \(T\) is a Hausdorff space if for every pair of distinct points \(x,y \in T\), there are disjoint open sets \(U,V\) such that \(x \in U\) and \(y \in V\).
            </p>

            <p>
            The intuition behind the Hausdorff property is that it allows us to distinguish any two points when looked through the lens of open sets.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b> Definition (Basis) </b> A basis for a topological space \(T\) is a collection \(\mathcal{B}\) of open sets such that every open set in \(T\) can be written as a union of sets in \(\mathcal{B}\).
            </p>

            <p>
            You can think of a basis of a topology as a collection that generates the topology by means of union. In particular, we say that a basis is a <b>countable basis</b> if it is, unsurprisingly, countable. Further, if a topology has a countable basis, we say that it is a <b>second-countable space</b>. Why second? Because there is a notion of first-countable. But we will not go into that.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b> Definition (Topological Manifold) </b> A manifold \(\mathcal{M}\) is a topological space \((X,\mathcal{T})\) that is Hausdorff, second-countable, and locally Euclidean. 
            </p>

            <p>
            As you can see, manifolds are object that reflect many properties of euclidean spaces. For example, looking through open sets, we can always distinguish any two points. We do also have a countable basis of open sets. And, locally, we can map the manifold to an euclidean space.
            </p>

            <p>
            More intuitively, you can think of a manifold as an object embedded in an euclidean space. For example, image a circle of radius 1 on the euclidean plane. You are looking at 1-dimensional manifold. Why 1-dimensional? Because you can describe all the point in the circle with a single parameter, the angle. Or, think of an hollow sphere. You are looking at a 2-dimensional manifold. Why 2-dimensional? Because you can describe all the points in the sphere with two parameters, the latitude and longitude. This means that you can map the circle to a line and the sphere to a plane.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b> Definition (Monoid) </b> We need only another small thing before introducing the concept of dynamical system. A monoid is a set \(X\) with an associative binary operation and an identity element. 
            </p>

            <p>
            For us, this is simply a set with the addition operation. For example, this could be \((\mathbb{Z},+)\) or \((\mathbb{R},+)\).
            </p>

            <h3> Dynamical System </h3>

            <p> 
            Now that we have done all this work, I want to confess that it was not really necessary. You can obtain the same results with a much simpler definition. However, we would lose the generality that the following definition provides. Ultimately, we won't need all this structure. But it was an excuse to refresh some concept from topology.
            </p>

            <p> <b> Definition (Dynamical System) </b> A dynamical system is a triplet \((T,\mathcal{M},f)\) where \(T\) is a monoid, \(\mathcal{M}\) is a manifold, and \(f:T \times \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}\) is a function such that 1) \(\forall x \in \mathcal{M} : f(x,0)=x\), and 2) \(\forall x \in \mathcal{M} : f(f(x,t_1),t_2) = f(x,t_1+t_2)\).
            </p>

            <p>
            Intuitively, \(T\) represents time. And, if time does not progress, the system does not either, so we have the requirement \(f(x,0)=x\) on the evolution function \(f\). Furthermore, the system evolves in a continuous way, so we have the requirement \(f(f(x,t_1),t_2) = f(x,t_1+t_2)\). This means that it does not matter if we evolve the system in one big step (\(t_1 + t_2\)) or in two small steps (\(t_1\) and \(t_2\)). Finally, we \(\mathcal{M}\) represents the state space, the points where the system can be.
            </p>

            <h4> Example 1 </h4>
            <p>
                Let us consider a first example of a continuous-time 1-dimensional dynamical system. The time monoid is simply \((\mathbb{R},+)\). The state space is simply the real line \(\mathbb{R}\). Meanwhile, the function \(f\) is induced by the update rule:
                \[
                    f(x,t) = x + t
                \]
            </p>
                
            <p>
            Note that, \(f(x,0)=x \) and \(f(f(x,t_1),t_2) = f(x+t_1, t_2) = x+t_1+t_2 f(x,t_1+t_2)\). This means that our update function is properly defined. Next, we know that the real line is a manifold (it is locally euclidean, second-countable, and Hausdorff). Also, \((\mathbb{R},+)\) is evidently a monoid. Therefore, we have a dynamical system.
            </p>

            <h4> Example 2 </h4>
            <p>
            Let us see a second example. Consider the manifold \(\mathbb{S}^1=\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2|x^2+y^2=1\}\) (the unit circle) and the monoid \((\mathbb{R},+)\). The update function is given by: 
            \[
            f((x,y),t) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(t\theta) & -\sin(t\theta) \\ \sin(t\theta) & \cos(t\theta) \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}
            \]
            </p>

            <p>
            Here, \(\theta\) is a fixed angle of choice. Note that, \(f((x,y),0) = (x,y)\). We also that that:
            \[
            \small{\begin{aligned}

            f(f((x,y),t_1),t_2) &= \begin{bmatrix} \cos(t_1\theta) & -\sin(t_1\theta) \\ \sin(t_1\theta) & \cos(t_1\theta) \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \cos(t_2\theta) & -\sin(t_2\theta) \\ \sin(t_2\theta) & \cos(t_2\theta) \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} \\
                                &= \begin{bmatrix} \cos(t_1\theta)\cos(t_2\theta) - \sin(t_1\theta)\sin(t_2\theta) & -\cos(t_1\theta)\sin(t_2\theta) - \sin(t_1\theta)\cos(t_2\theta) \\ \sin(t_1\theta)\cos(t_2\theta) + \cos(t_1\theta)\sin(t_2\theta) & - \sin(t_1\theta)\sin(t_2\theta) + \cos(t_1\theta)\cos(t_2\theta) \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} \\
                                &= \begin{bmatrix} \cos((t_1+t_2)\theta) & -\sin((t_1+t_2)\theta) \\ \sin((t_1+t_2)\theta) & \cos((t_1+t_2)\theta)\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = f((x,y),t_1+t_2)
            \end{aligned}}
            \]

            So, the evolution function is proper. We also know that our choice of time is proper. We need only to show that the unit circle is a manifold. But you will have to trust me on this one.
            </p>

            <p>
            Now that you arrived to this point, you deserve an animation of this simple dynamical system
            </p>

            <div id="canvas-container-circle" xscale=15 yscale=10 xshift=0 yshift=100 width=700 height=150></div>

            <p>
            Ok, this is not as impressive as the animation at the start of the page. But, it describer fairly well what's going on.
            </p>

            <h3> Autonomous and Non-Autonomous Systems </h3>

            <p>
            Now, that we have a good understanding of what a dynamical system is, we need to know that we rarely will describe these systems as we did previously, with the updated function. More often, we will see a set of equations that describes the evolution of the system. These equations can be categorized into two main categories: <b>autonomous</b> and <b>non-autonomous</b> systems.
            </p>

            <p>
            Autonomous systems are systems that do not depend on time to determine the next state in the system. For example, \(g(x)=2x\) is an autonomous system. Meanwhile, \(g(x,t)=2x+t\) is a non-autonomous system. Notice that, as they are, these systems are not dynamical systems as the properties of the update function are not met. However, we can easily induce a dynamical system from these equations. 
            </p>

            <p>
            For the autonomous function, we can define the dynamical system \((\mathbb{N},+),\mathbb{R},(x,t \mapsto g^t(x)))\) where \(g^t\) is the \(t\)-th iteration of the function \(g\). Since this autonomous system is particularly simple, we can even write the update function as \(f(x,t)=2^tx\). We can easily see that \(f(x,0)=2^0x=x\) and \(f(f(x,t_1),t_2)=f(2^{t_1}x,t_2)=2^{t_1+t_2}x=f(x,t_1+t_2)\). So we have a proper dynamical system.
            </p>

            <p>
            For the non-autonomous function, the story is a little bit more complicated. We cannot use the system as an update function directly. We need to augment the state space to include time. So that, we can make the same trick we did with the autonomous system. So we get a dynamical system like \((\mathbb{N},+),\mathbb{R}^2,(x,t,\tau \mapsto g^\tau(x,t))\). Here, the role of time is taken by \(\tau\). 
            </p>

            <p>
            The trick of iterating the function is very simple, but it works only for dynamical system with discrete time. To have a dynamical system with continuous time, we need to specify our equations differently. Instead of specifying the next state, we will describe the velocity vector of the state. This can be done using differential equations. Like before, let's see a couple of examples.
            </p>

            <p>
            Let's suppose our manifold is \(\mathbb{R}\). We want a velocity vector that is proportional to the state. More precisely, if the state at time \(t\) is \(x(t)\), we want the velocity vector to be \(2x(t)\). So, we are saying that:
            \[
                \frac{dx(t)}{dt} = 2x(t)
            \]
            </p>

            <p>
            To get our dynamical system, we need to solve this differential equation. Let's get started:
            \[
            \begin{aligned}
                \frac{dx(t)}{dt} &= 2x(t) \\
                \int \frac{1}{x(t)}dx(t) &= \int 2dt \\
                \ln|x(t)| &= 2t + C \\
                x(t) &= e^{2t+C} = C'e^{2t}
            \end{aligned}
            \]
            Now, we have a family of solutions that describes how the state space evolves over time. Our family of dynamical system becomes \( ((\mathbb{R},+),\mathbb{R},(x,t \mapsto C'e^{2t})) \). It is fairly easy to see that the update function is proper for each choice of \(C'\).
            </p>

            <h4> Summary and and Cautionary Note </h4>

            <p>
            In this section, we have discussed autonomous and non-autonomous systems as a way to build dynamical systems. We have done so with discrete time using the iteration of the system. And, we have done so in continuous time using differential equations. 
            </p>

            <p>
            However, I want to stress that while putting this notes togheter I could not find a good resource that made a distinction between autonomous/non-autonomous systems and dynamical one while, here, I treat them as very different things. Furthermore, it is often more easy to reason about dynamical systems in terms of the autonomous/non-autonomous systems than in terms of the induced dynamical system itself. Well, if you any insight on this, please let me know.
            </p>

            <h3> Fixed Points and their Stability </h3>

            <p>
            The stability of fixed points is one of the most important concepts in chaos theory. It allows us to understand how the system behaves around a fixed point. So, let's start by defining what a fixed point is.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b> Definition (Fixed Point) </b> A fixed point of a dynamical system \((T,\mathcal{M},f)\) is a point \(x \in \mathcal{M}\) such that \(f(x,t)=x\) for all \(t \in T\).
            </p>

            <p>
            In other words, a fixed point is a point that does not change over time. It is a point that is invariant under the evolution of the system. For example, if we are modelling the evolution of a population over time, a fixed point would certainly be \(0\) as no new individuals are born or die, regardless oftime.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b> Definition (Sink) </b> A fixed point \(x\) is a sink if there is a neighborhood \(U\) of \(x\) such that for any point \(y \in U\), \(\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} f(y,t) = x\)
            </p>

            <p>
            This is pretty simple. We are saying that if we start close enough to the fixed point and evolve the system over time, we will get arbitrarly close to the fixed point. However, we need to be careful. If we treat time, \(T\) as a monoid, like before, we do not have a concept of limit to infinity. We need to more structure to make sense of this definition. So, for this section, we will consider \(T\) to be either \( \mathbb{N} \) or \( \mathbb{R} \). But you could use different structures to define the limit to infinity (for instance, an ordered monoid).
            </p>

            <p>
            Here's an example of a vector field that has a sink at the origin.
            </p>
            
            <canvas id="sink" width="350" height="200" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></canvas>

            <p>
            <b> Definition (Source) </b> A fixed point \(x\) is a source if there is a neighborhood \(U\) of \(x\) such that for any point \(y \in U\setminus \{x\}\), \(\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} f(y,t)\not \in U\)
            </p>

            <p>
            This is the opposite of a sink. If we start close enough to the fixed point and evolve the system over time, we will eventually get out of the neighborhood of the fixed point.
            </p>

            <p>
            Here's an example of a vector field that has a source at the origin.
            </p>
 
            <canvas id="source" width="350" height="200" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></canvas>

            <p>
            Now, that we know what a sink and a source are, we concern ourselves on how these points can be classified. In other words, we want a reliable method to determine if a fixed point is a sink or a source. As it turns out, there is a very simple way to do this. We can look at the derivative of the system at the fixed point. But wait a minute, we never said that our manifold are differentiable. So, we will take a break from the dynamical system stuff to talk a little bit about differntiable manifolds.
            </p>

            <h3> Differentiable Manifolds </h3>

            <p>
            <b> Definition (Chart) </b> Let \(\mathcal{M}\) be a manifold. A chart on \(\mathcal{M}\) is a pair \((U,\phi)\) where \(U\) is an open set in \(\mathcal{M}\) and \(\phi:U \rightarrow \phi(U) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) is a homeomorphism (bijective and both \(f\) and \(f^-1\) are continuos) with \(\phi(U)\) also open.
            </p>

            <p>
            Having a chart on a manifold is like having a map between a patch of the manifold (the open set \(U\)) and to a patch of the euclidean space (the open set \(\phi(U)\)). Further, we require this transition to be smooth in both directions (from the manifold to the euclidean space and vice-versa). 
            </p>

            <p>
            <b> Definition (Overlapping Charts) </b> Two charts \((U_i,\phi_i)\) and \((U_j,\phi_j)\) are said to overlap if \(U_i \cap U_j \neq \emptyset\).
            </p>

            <p>
            Nothing to be said here. Just that we need to define this concept to define the next one.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b> Definition (Smooth) </b> A function \(f:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m\) is smooth if all the partial derivatives of all orders exist and are continuous.
            </p>

            <p>
            Smooth functions are those function that are differentiable as many times as you want. Often you will find this class of function under the symbol \(C^\infty\).

            <b> Definition (Atlas) </b> An atlas on a manifold \(\mathcal{M}=(X,T)\) is a collection of charts \(\{(U_i,\phi_i)\}_{i \in I}\) such that: 1) \(X \subseteq \cup_{i\in I} U_i \) (that is the open set cover the manifold). 2) For any pair of overlapping charts  \((U_i,\phi_i)\) and \((U_j,\phi_j)\) in the atlas, the transition function \(\phi_j \circ \phi_i^{-1}: \phi_i(U_i \cap U_j) \rightarrow \phi_j(U_i \cap U_j)\) is smooth (that is the charts are compatible).
            </p>

            <p>
            First of all, we are saying that an atlas needs tp cover the whole manifold, nothing surprising. However, we also require a certain property on overlapping charts. We require that the transition between the euclidean patch, image of \(\phi_i\), and the euclidean patch, image of \(\phi_j\), is smooth (and vice-versa). 
            </p>

            <p>
            The atlas of manifold is the object from which many other definition will depend. It is our way to the euclidean space. This way will allow us transport many useful concepts from the euclidean space to the manifold. A, differntial manifold is simply a manifold with an atlas that will allow us transport the concept of differentiation from the euclidean space to the manifold itself.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b> Definition (Differentiable Manifold) </b> A manifold \(\mathcal{M}=(X,T)\) is a differentiable manifold if it has an a smooth atlas.
            </p>

            <p>
            Now, we have the object in which we can compute the differentiation. However, how do we compute the derivative. In  order to do so, let start with an anology. Conisder a curve paratrized according to a time parameter \(t\) living in a n-dimensional euclidean space. We know that the derivative at a point is the tangent vector to the curve at that point. For instance, consider the 2-dimensional curve \(\gamma(t)=(t,\cos(t) + t)\). I have plotted the curve altogether with its (normalized) tangent vectors at several points in the figure below. Each tangent vector (which represent the derivative) lives in the tangent space of \mathbb{R}^2 at the point of interest.

            <p>
            In \(\mathbb{R}^n\), you can imagine the tangent space at point \(p\), \(T_p\mathbb{R}^n\), as the space of all possible tangent vectors at the point \(p\). This is a n-dimensional vector space. Below, I plot the 2-dimensional euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^2\) with the tangent space at the point \((1,1)\) in green, \(T_{(1,1)}\mathbb{R}^2\).

            <p>
            We have the euclidea tangent space. What is the manifold tangent space? For this, we will use our atlas. So consider a chart \((U,\phi)\) from a differentiable manifold \(\mathcal{M}\). We can define the tangent space at a point \(p \in U\), \(T_p\mathcal{M}\), as the euclidean tangent space at the image of point \(p\), that is \(T_{\phi(p)}\mathbb{R}^n\). 
            </p>

            <p>
            <b> Definition (Tangent Space) </b> Let \(\mathcal{M}=(X,T)\) be a differentiable manifold with atlas \(\{(U_i,\phi_i)\}_{i \in I}\). The tangent space at a point \(p \in U_i\), is \(T_p\mathcal{M} = T_{\phi_i(p)}\mathbb{R}^n\). The set of all tangent spaces at all points in the manifold is denoted by \(T\mathcal{M}\).
            </p> 

            <p>
            Now, let us consider a generic function from a differentiable manifold to another, \(f:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow\mathcal{N}\). We will define the derivative of this function at a point \(p\in\mathcal{M}\) simply by using the charts. Let \((U,\phi)\) and \((V,\psi)\) be charts on \(\mathcal{M}\) and \(\mathcal{N}\) respectively such that \(p\in U\) and \(f(p)\in V)\). We define the derivative of \(f\) at \(p\) as the derivative of the function \(\psi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1} = g\) at the point \(\phi(p)\). 
            </p>

            <p>
            Note that this is an intuitive definition. We do not know how to compute the derivative of \(f\) directly at a point \(p\). However, we can project \(p\) to the euclidean space, and use the charts to derive a transformation from and to euclidean space. The derivative of \(f\) a \(p\) will be whatever the derivative of \(g\) at \(\phi(p)\) is.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Despite its intuitiveness, we will have that derivative of \(f\) will depend on the choice of charts. Meaning that, different charts will give different derivatives. We could define the derivative, in such a way that it does not depend on the charts. However, when will need to compute the derivative, we will need to choose a chart anyway. So, we will not bother with this. 
            </p>

            <p>
            <b>Definition (Derivative)</b> Let \(\mathcal{M}\) and \(\mathcal{N}\) be differentiable manifolds. Let \(f:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow\mathcal{N}\) be a function. Let \(p \in \mathcal{M}\). Let \((U,\phi)\) and \((V,\psi)\) be charts on \(\mathcal{M}\) and \(\mathcal{N}\) respectively such that \(p\in U\) and \(f(p)\in V\). The derivative of \(f\) at \(p\) wrt. charts \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) is the jacobian matrix:
            \[
            \begin{aligned}
            D^{\phi,\psi}f(p) = \Large{\begin{bmatrix}  
                \frac{\partial (\psi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1})^i)}
                {\partial x^j}\Bigg|_{\phi(p)}
                \end{bmatrix}}
            \end{aligned}
            \]
            </p>

            <p>
            This is definetely still a little bit abstract. But, we can do a simple example to understand this better.
            </p>

            <h4> Example </h4>

            <p>
            Consider the manifold, \(\mathcal{M}\), made up of point between \(-30\) and \(+30\), \(\{x|x\in(-30,+30)\}\). Consider also the manifold \(\mathcal{N}\), made up from point in the unitary shere \(\{x|x\in\mathbb{R}^3,||x||=1\}\). Let \(f:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow\mathcal{N}\) be the function that maps a point \(x\) to the point in the unitary sphere:
            \[
            f(t)=(\frac{\cos(t)}{\sqrt{1+a^2t^2}},\frac{\sin(t)}{\sqrt{1+a^2t^2}},\frac{at}{\sqrt{1+a^2t^2}})
            \]
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Now, we need to define the charts. We will use the chart \((U,\phi)\) on \(\mathcal{M}\) such that \(U=(-30,+30)\) and \(\phi(x)=x\). We will use the stereographic projections for the sphere. That si, \((V,\psi)\) such that \(V\) is the unitary sphere (excluded the north pole) and \(\psi(x,y,z)=(x/(1-z),y/(1-z))\).
            </p>

            <p>
            Over the situtation can be pictured as follows:
            </p>

            <canvas id="example" width="700" height="600" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></canvas>

            <p>
            Using \(\phi\), we can go back and forth from the manifold \(\mathcal{M}\) to the 1-dimensional euclidean space. Using \(\psi\), we can go back and forth from the manifold \(\mathcal{N}\) to the euclidean space. With \(f\), we can go from \(\mathcal{M}\) to \(\mathcal{N}\). Now, we will compute the derivative of \(f\) with respect to the charts \(\phi\) and \(\psi\), this is \(D^{\phi,\psi}f(t)\).

            \[
            \psi(f(t)) = \left( \frac{\cos(t)}{\sqrt{1+a^2t^2} - at}, \frac{\sin(t)}{\sqrt{1+a^2t^2} - at} \right).
            \]

            \[
            \begin{aligned}
            D^{\phi,\psi}f(t) &= \Large{\begin{bmatrix}  
                \frac{\partial (\psi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1})^i)}
                {\partial x^j}\Bigg|_{\phi(p)}
                \end{bmatrix}} \\
                &= \Large{\begin{bmatrix}
                \frac{\partial \frac{\cos(t)}{\sqrt{1+a^2t^2} - at}}{\partial t} & \frac{\partial \frac{\sin(t)}{\sqrt{1+a^2t^2} - at}}{\partial t} \\
                \end{bmatrix}} \\
                &= \begin{bmatrix}
                (-1 - \frac{at}{\sqrt{1 + a^2 t^2}})(-a \cos(t) + \sqrt{1 + a^2 t^2} \sin(t)) \\
                (+1 + \frac{at}{\sqrt{1 + a^2 t^2}})(\sqrt{1 + a^2 t^2} \cos(t) + a \sin(t))
                \end{bmatrix}^T

            \end{aligned}
            \]
            </p>

            <p>
            We can verify that indeed these derivative are correct by plotting them in the sphere.

            <h4> Summary And Cautionary Note </h4>

            <p>
            In this section, we have introduced the concept of differentiable manifold. We have defined the tangent space at a point of the manifold. We have also defined the derivative of a function between manifolds. We have done so using charts. We have also done a simple example to illustrate how to compute the derivative of a function between manifolds.
            </p>

            <p>
            Some readers may have expected to see the derivative arrows on the 3d plot. However, the 3d plot is only a 3d-visualization of the manifold. In all reality the manifold \(\mathcal{N}\) is only 2-dimensional. As consequence the derivative of the function \(f\) will be a 2-dimensional vector.
            </p>

            <p>
            The most advanced readers may complain regarding the chart dependant definition of the derivative. They may argue that the derivative should be defined in such a way that it does not depend on the charts. This is possible, however, it requires a level of abstraction that it is not needed for this post.
